The experience your group has and the depth of the conversation can be directly impacted by the relationship you both build prior to the first session. Make it a point to meet beforehand. You will meet the people in your group at the first session.<br /><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">Please note that with space constraints and a need for intentional racial make-up of our groups, we ask that only those who directly receive these emails attend the training dates.<br /><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">We look forward to seeing you at training!<br /></span></div>
